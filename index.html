    <p class="my-para">
        This page is dedicated to my interest in cars. I was never into cars as a child, but as I got older I started to appreciate cars more.
        While I really only enjoy how cars are styled and not so much their mechanical specifications, I still find myself looking at cars both new and old - 
        those with modern looks and those with older and perhaps even stranger designs. In the nav bar above, I have my top 3 favorite car brands. They each link to a seperate page
        that covers my top 3 favorite cars from those brands.

    <div class="my-car roboto-black-italic"></div>
    <p class="my-para" style="border: none; background-color: antiquewhite;">
        My car means the world to me. It's my biggest purchase ever, as it's something that I worked for and earned all on my own. At the time, purchasing this car
        was a turning point in my adulthood; it was confirmation that I was on the right track in life and that everything would only get better.

            <li>For a time, I added a spoiler, but the adhesive wasn't strong enough; for now, it remains off the car...</li>

    <p class="my-para" style="border: none; background-color: antiquewhite;">
        <ol style="margin-left: 30%; font-size: 1.5em;">
            <li>Install an aftermarket grill that would allow for better airflow + looks nicer. Check it out <a id="ebay-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/225524061096">here!</a></li>
            <li>Add an aftermarket (or OEM if possible) sunroof to my car.</li>
            <li>Get legal permissions to tint my windows and then go for a reasonable tint level.</li>
            <li>DIY paint job on some of the grey plastics and turn them black.</li>
            <li>Whatever else I can think of! I use a lot of different websites for inspiration.</li>
